Samer Flux on board: 
Models point arrows at views, but views don't point arrows at models at first. This is a contraint. 
Later, if view needs to instruct model with something, then loop. Their arrows go through a dispatch before pointing to the back of the models. Thus, this is all one direction. 
Samer: Model is read from the view. View is read from models and sent to dispatcher. every component has job to do.
Between views and dispatcher is Action. Something needs to happen.  
The arrows from models to views are labled with "read/ listen". It reads and listens to the models. It broadcasts that I changed. 
This is a lot different than MVC. Contraint is can only go in that one direction. You dont' have to code in this direction but the flow is always this way.

The view needs the data, but we can't send it to the view. We can only have the dispatcher tell data?

Flux is really just a dispatcher.
